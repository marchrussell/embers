Thank you for choosing March, operated by March Collective Ltd ("March", "we", "us", "our"), registered in England and Wales.

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our digital products and services, including our website www.marchrussell.com, our mobile and web applications (the "App"), and all related materials and features (collectively, the "Products" or "Services").

By using our Products, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

1. About March

March provides specialist breathwork classes, at your fingertips, designed for personal wellness and educational purposes.

The content provided through our App and Website is not medical advice and should not be used to diagnose or treat any condition. Always consult your doctor or qualified healthcare professional before undertaking any new wellness or breathwork routine.

Use of our Services is entirely at your own risk.

1.1 Membership and Accounts

To access certain features, you may register for a March account by providing accurate and complete information. You must:

• Keep your login credentials confidential;
• Maintain up-to-date account information;
• Be at least 16 years old to create an account;
• If you are under 16, you may only use the Services with parental or guardian consent, and that adult agrees to these Terms on your behalf;
• Not create multiple accounts or share your account access.

You are responsible for all activity under your account.

By registering, you may receive updates or offers from March; you can unsubscribe at any time.
For how we handle your personal data, see our Privacy Policy.

1.2 Paid Subscriptions (March Premium)

You can purchase subscriptions ("March Premium") through Stripe on www.marchrussell.com. Subscriptions provide access to enhanced content and features.

a. Subscription Terms

Subscriptions are available on a monthly or annual basis, billed in GBP or local currency.

Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled. Renewal will charge the same payment method you provided via Stripe.

We will send a renewal reminder email at least seven (7) days before automatic renewal.

You may cancel at any time through your account or by contacting march@marchrussell.com.

b. Free Trial (7 Days)

If you begin a free trial, it will last for 7 days from the date of activation. At the end of the trial, your plan will automatically convert into a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial ends.

You can cancel anytime during the trial through your account dashboard or by emailing march@marchrussell.com.
We will send a reminder email at least 3 days before the trial ends to let you know that payment will be taken unless you cancel.

c. Cancellation and Refunds

Under UK consumer law:

You have a 14-day cooling-off period from the date of purchase. However, by starting your subscription immediately, you acknowledge that access begins right away and you lose your right to withdraw once digital content is made available.

You may still cancel at any time to prevent future renewals.

Refunds are only available where the service is faulty, unavailable, or not as described.

If you believe you qualify for a refund, email march@marchrussell.com with your order details.

d. Price Changes

We may adjust pricing. You will always be notified in advance and have the option to cancel before any new price takes effect.

• Are valid for new users only unless otherwise stated.

1.4 Third-Party Services

Our Services may include integrations or links to third-party platforms (e.g. Stripe, Apple, Google, or social media).
Your use of such services is subject to their own terms and privacy policies. March is not responsible for their actions, policies, or content.

1.5 Updates to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect legal, operational, or business changes.
Updated Terms will be posted on www.marchrussell.com/terms.

Your continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

3. Health & Wellness Disclaimer

The content in March is for general educational and wellness purposes.
It does not constitute medical advice or diagnosis. You are responsible for determining whether breathwork or any activity within the App is suitable for you.

Do not use March while driving, operating machinery, or performing any activity requiring focus.
If you experience dizziness, pain, or discomfort, stop immediately and consult a medical professional.

Certain health conditions (e.g. pregnancy, cardiovascular issues, respiratory disorders, mental health conditions) may make some breathwork practices unsuitable.
Use the Services at your own discretion and risk.

March Collective Ltd and its instructors or partners accept no liability for any injury, loss, or damage resulting from participation.

You may not copy, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any part of our Services without prior written consent.
Any unauthorised use may result in termination of your access and possible legal action.

5. Availability and Maintenance

We strive to keep the Services available at all times but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access.
We may temporarily suspend access for maintenance, improvements, or security reasons.
We are not liable for downtime or interruptions beyond our reasonable control.

If a fault materially impacts your paid access, please contact us and we will investigate and, where appropriate, offer repair, replacement, or refund options consistent with UK consumer law.

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

March Collective Ltd shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or business opportunities.

Our total liability for any claim arising from or relating to your use of the Services shall not exceed the total amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

Nothing in these Terms excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any matter where liability cannot lawfully be excluded.

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales.
Both parties agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

If you are a consumer residing outside the UK, you may also benefit from mandatory rights provided by your local consumer laws. Nothing in these Terms limits those rights.
